# These are requirements that have been known to be problamatic, this
# could be for a number of reasons:
# * Excessive backtracking causing slow resolution
# * Excessive backtracking causing build failure
# * Excessive backtracking causing ResolutionTooDeep
#
# Scenarios may be taken from other installers as even if pip doesn't
# currently file the resolution problematic it might one day regress
